////////////////////3.SUMMARY OF CHANGES AND SHORTCOMINGS/TECHNICAL ERRORS//////////////////
////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


The site has been implemented by means of HTML and CSS with additional image files.
The design has been improved from the original paper prototypes and those changes have been 
accounted for. 

Several small design changes such as navbar button re-ordering, consolidating the rampcam and 
book a session feature to one page, as well as having contact info and a map of the store being 
on the home page only.

*WARNING*: The search button on the home page has not yet been implemented

Right now the implementation of the site is not ideal or optimized. 
There is several HTML and CSS files that in the future will be consolidated along with the help of javascript.
The purpose of this prototype is to have a basic design implemented that can be interacted with and analyzed.
Most links and buttons have no functionality yet due to the early stages of development but all
three of the task scenarios have been supported and are possible when following the instructions.
The visual appeal is not ideal either, alot more css and design tweaks needs to be implemented 
if this website were to be launched to the public. The user may find small bugs and errors that cause
small visual tweaks but all the core functionality supporting the task scenarios will be present.

There is much more work to be done on the site to implement the rest of the features and make it 
more presentable. This prototype serves a limited purpose for now but has the essential design as 
a concrete model that can be interacted with.
